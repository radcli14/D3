# dRuBbLe in 3-D
_A Silly Game With Silly Stools_

The smash hit game dRuBbLe in 3-D using the Unity engine.
The objective is to bounce a ball on top of a stool, either to cover the maximum distance, or to compete in a volleyball-like sport.
In the background are landmarks from Washington, DC.
dRuBbLe was previously written in pure Python code using the [Kivy](kivy.org) multiplatform development engine.
